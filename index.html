        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Classical motion planning for robotic manipulation includes a set of general algorithms that aim to minimize
            a scene-specific cost of executing a given plan to generate a
            potentially valid collision-free trajectory. This approach offers
            remarkable adaptability, as they can be directly used for any
            new scene without needing specific training datasets. However,
            without a prior understanding of what diverse valid trajectories
            are and without specially designed cost functions for a given
            scene, the overall solutions tend to have low success rates.
            While deep-learning-based algorithms tremendously improve
            success rates, they are much harder to adopt without specialized
            training datasets. We propose EDMP, an Ensemble-of-costs-
            guided Diffusion for Motion Planning that aims to combine the
            strengths of classical and deep-learning-based motion planning.
            Our diffusion-based network is trained on a set of diverse
            general valid trajectories enabling the model to implicitly learn
            the properties of a valid trajectory. Like classical planning, for
            any new scene at the time of inference, we compute collision
            costs and incorporate this cost at each timestep of the diffusion
            network to generate valid collision-free trajectories. Instead of
            a single collision cost that may be insufficient in capturing
            diverse cues across scenes, we use an ensemble of collision
            costs to guide the diffusion process, significantly improving
            the success rate compared to classical planners. As we show
            in our experiments, EDMP outperforms SOTA deep-learning-
            based methods in most cases while retaining the generalization
            capabilities primarily associated with classical planners</p>

        <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
        <p> In the shadowy depths of academia, we offer our 'special' acknowledgment to Jayaram. Their contributions to this research paper were, shall we say, truly distinctive. Jayaram's ability to keep us guessing about the direction of our work was like a never-ending thriller novel - you never quite knew what plot twist was coming next.

            Jayaram's unique interpretation of research concepts often left us pondering the mysteries of the universe, or at least the mysteries of their thought process. It's not every day you encounter a collaborator who can turn a straightforward discussion into a dark and twisted intellectual journey.
            
            While our understanding of the universe may forever be altered after working with Jayaram, we can't deny that they added an element of dark humor to our academic pursuits. To Jayaram, for keeping us entertained and challenged, we raise a metaphorical toast (and perhaps a flashlight) in your honor
